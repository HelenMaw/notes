## Week 2 - Bits and Bytes
- Bits small unit of data. Bytes 8 Bits

- KB, MB, GB, TB are units of data storage
## Week 3 - Working with Text
- Keyboard and Mouse are to interact with computers
- Touch Typing improves speed and accuracy
- Keyboard and Ergonomics:the issue are Back pain, strain injuries
- And fixed good posture, stretching, breaks
- QWERTY is standard
- Dvorak: faster but harder to learn
- Keyboard Shortcuts: Ctrl + C → Copy, Ctrl + V → Paste, Ctrl + Z → Undo, Ctrl + Shift + P → VS Code command search, Ctrl + F → Search
Ctrl + H → Find & replace
- Mechanical Keyboards: Brown switches → Tactile, quiet, Red switches → Smooth, no click, Blue switches → Clicky, loud
- VS Code Basics:Ctrl + P → Switch files, Ctrl + Shift + P → Command palette, VS Code Online → Change .com to .dev in GitHub repo
