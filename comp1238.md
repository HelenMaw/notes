## Week 1 - History
- Sumerians in Mesopotamia created Cuneiform the writing system. They record to tade, taxes andn laws.
- They started written on clay tablets with a stylus and  later became abstract wedge-shaped symbols.  
- Numbering system base on 60 (eg. 60 seconds in a minute/ 360 degreees in a circle. It is useful for fractions and measurements.
- They solved mathematic for quadratic equations and used pythagorean triples.
- Typeface is the metal surface and font is print version
- Serif is line on letter
## Week 2 - Bits and Bytes
- Bits small unit of data. Bytes 8 Bits
- Text file: store human-readable data (e.g., ASCII characters)
- Binary Files: store machine-readable data (e.g., executable files, images)
- Binary base on 2: uses 0 and 1
- Binary counting: each digit in binary represents a power of 2
- Hexadecimal base on 16: uses 0-9 and A-F
- Floating Point: uses for fractional numbers
- Storage Devices: SSD is fast, reliable storage, and Spinning Disks are larger, slower storage
- - KB, MB, GB, TB are units of data storage
## Week 3 - Text Structure
- Punctuation: commas, periods, and question marks separate and clarify text
- White Space: spaces, tabs, and new lines that organize text and make it readable
- Line Breaks: indicates the end of a line and the start of a new one. important to structure text for clarity (e.g., paragraphs or bullet points)
- Markup Languages: Markdown and HTML
- Markdown is simple, readable, and used for creating content like documentation
- HTML is more complex structuring web pages with tags like <div>, <p>, etc
- Markdown Syntax:
- Headings: Use # (1 for largest heading, 6 for smallest).
- Bold: Use **bold** or __bold__
- Italic: Use *italic* or _italic_
- Bullet Lists: Use - or * for items
- Numbered Lists: Use 1., 2., etc
- Links: Use [Link text](URL) for links
- Images: Use ![alt text](Image URL) for images
- HTML Syntax: HTML Tags: like <h1> for headings, <p> for paragraphs, and <a> for links
- Structured Data Formats: JSON, XML:
- JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight format for storing and exchanging data. easy to read and write
- XML (Extensible Markup Language) is used to define data with a custom structure. more complex than JSON and often used in web services
## Week 4 - Working with Text
- Keyboard and Mouse are to interact with computers
- Touch Typing improves speed and accuracy
- Keyboard and Ergonomics:the issue are Back pain, strain injuries
- And fixed good posture, stretching, breaks
- QWERTY is standard
- Dvorak: faster but harder to learn
- Keyboard Shortcuts: Ctrl + C → Copy, Ctrl + V → Paste, Ctrl + Z → Undo, Ctrl + Shift + P → VS Code command search, Ctrl + F → Search
Ctrl + H → Find & replace
- Mechanical Keyboards: Brown switches → Tactile, quiet, Red switches → Smooth, no click, Blue switches → Clicky, loud
- VS Code Basics:Ctrl + P → Switch files, Ctrl + Shift + P → Command palette, VS Code Online → Change .com to .dev in GitHub repo
- Ctrl + P → Switch between open files, Ctrl + Shift + P → Open command palette
- [0-9] → Matches any digit (0-9)
- [ABC] → Matches A, B, or C
- + → Matches one or more of the previous character
- {6} → Matches exactly 6 of the previous character
- Right-click = Rename
- Select file = Press F2
- *.txt → Finds all .txt files
- M*.txt → Finds all .txt files starting with "M"
## Week 5 - Linux & CLI Basics
- Linux Experience Poll (Scale 1-5) :1 = Never heard of it, 5 = Use daily
- Text, Numbers & Encoding : ASCII, Unicode → Standard text encoding, Keyboards, text editors, search tools
- Command Line (CLI): another way to control a computer
- Use for remote servers
- History: Started with punched cards → printed results → interactive terminals
- Today: Type command → See response → Repeat
- Types of CLI :Linux/Mac: Bash, Zsh (Unix-style)/ Windows: Cmd (old), PowerShell (advanced), WSL (Linux on Windows), Git Bash
- Why Use CLI? 1. Automation (scripting) 2. Faster for experienced users 3. Low resource usage (good for weak hardware & remote servers)
- CLI Basics 
- ls → List files
- pwd → Show current directory
- cd <dir> → Change directory
- cd .. → Go up one level
- cat <file> → Show file contents
- less <file> → View long files (exit with q)
- cp <source> <dest> → Copy file
- mv <source> <dest> → Move/Rename file
- rm <file> → Delete file
- mkdir <dir> → Create directory
- rmdir <dir> → Delete empty directory
- clear → Clear terminal
- Piping & Redirection
- ls -l | wc -l → Count files in directory
- command > file.txt → Save output to file
- command >> file.txt → Append output to file
